            <h2>The Iconic G-Pant</h2>
            <p>where it all began</p>
            <p>The G-Pant is where it all began. Designed in the early 1980s with rock climbing in mind, these trousers quickly became a staple for those who valued movement, durability, and function. </p>
            <p>Tough enough for the crag, but comfortable enough for everyday wear, they laid the blueprint for generations of outdoor-ready gear.</p>

            <h2>180 degree flexibility</h2>
            <p>where it all began</p>
            <p>The G-Pant was built for movement. That signature diamond-shaped gusset in the crotch was borrowed from high-kicking karate trousers, it allows for full 180-degree flexibility—perfect for scrambling up rock faces, and for pretty much anyone who needs a bit of extra movement.</p>

            <h2>Tough, Functional and Timeless</h2>
            <p>Build to last</p>
            <p>Made from organic cotton twill, the G-Pant is as tough as they come. </p>
            <p>The built-in nylon belt and elasticated waistband means they are adjustable and  comfortable. They have a relaxed shape, with a low rise and plenty of room around the hips. The legs gently taper from hip to hem.</p>
            <p>Over the years, we’ve refined the details, adding a zip fly and rear pockets, but the core design remains unchanged.</p>

            <h2>More Than Just a Climbing Pant</h2>
            <p>Beyond Yosemite</p>
            <p>The G-Pant’s versatility took it beyond the cliffs of Yosemite. By the mid-80s, skaters, surfers, and explorers of all kinds were drawn to its durable construction and effortless style. Before long, Gramicci had found a new audience—one that valued function just as much as form.</p>
            <p>From Japan’s streetwear scene to forward-thinking outdoor stores around the world, the G-Pant cemented its place as an icon.</p>

            <h2>More Than Just a Climbing Pant</h2>
            <p>A New Take on a Classic</p>
            <p>For 2025, we’ve introduced a new addition to the lineup, the G-Pant Straight Fit.</p>
            <p>It’s everything you love about the original, but with a straight-leg silhouette for an even more relaxed shape. Whereas the G-Pant has an 8 inch hem, the G-Pant Straight-fit has a roomier 9 1/2 inch hem.</p>
            <p>Wider at the hem and a little shorter in leg length, but still packed with those original Gramicci details, this new version is an alternative for those who like a little extra room.</p>
